# TICKET-001: Delta-Compressed Checkpoint System

## Description
Implement a delta-compressed checkpoint system for efficient timing data storage and retrieval. This system will reduce checkpoint sizes from ~500MB to ~50MB by storing only incremental changes between timing stages, enabling faster save/restore operations and reduced storage requirements.

## High-Level Specification
- Design and implement TimingStage data structure with base checkpoint references
- Create CompressedDelta format for storing incremental state changes
- Implement checkpoint versioning for rollback capabilities
- Build compression pipeline using LZ4/Zstd algorithms
- Develop checkpoint validation and integrity checking

## Relevant Files
- `src/openroad_mcp/timing/checkpoint.py` (to be created)
- `src/openroad_mcp/timing/models.py` (to be created)
- `src/openroad_mcp/timing/compression.py` (to be created)
- `src/openroad_mcp/core/manager.py` (integration point)
- `tests/test_checkpoint.py` (existing test file)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TimingStage data structure supports base references and delta changes
- [ ] CompressedDelta format achieves 90% size reduction
- [ ] Checkpoint creation completes within 10 seconds for large designs
- [ ] Restore operations maintain data integrity with validation
- [ ] Versioning system allows rollback to previous checkpoints
- [ ] Integration with OpenROADManager for timing data persistence
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 95% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks validate size and speed requirements

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Create timing module structure and base models
- [ ] Design TimingStage and CompressedDelta data structures
- [ ] Implement compression algorithms with LZ4/Zstd
- [ ] Build checkpoint creation with delta calculation
- [ ] Implement restore functionality with decompression
- [ ] Add versioning and rollback capabilities
- [ ] Create validation and integrity checking
- [ ] Integrate with OpenROADManager
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Perform performance benchmarking

## Priority
High

## Status
Todo

## Dependencies
- OpenROAD process management (completed)
- Basic MCP server infrastructure (completed)

## Technical Details
### Data Structure Design
```python
class TimingStage:
    stage_id: str
    timestamp: datetime
    base_checkpoint_ref: str  # Reference to shared base state
    delta_changes: CompressedDelta  # Only incremental changes
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
```

### Compression Strategy
- Use LZ4 for speed-critical operations
- Use Zstd for maximum compression when storage is priority
- Implement adaptive compression based on data characteristics

## Notes
- This is the foundation for all timing query operations
- Must maintain backward compatibility with future versions
- Consider memory-mapped files for large checkpoints
- Implement streaming compression for memory efficiency
