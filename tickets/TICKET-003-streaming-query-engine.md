# TICKET-003: Streaming Query Engine

## Description
Implement a streaming query engine for memory-efficient processing of large timing datasets. This engine will enable processing of massive result sets without loading everything into memory, supporting pagination, backpressure handling, and real-time streaming of OpenSTA command outputs.

## High-Level Specification
- Design streaming architecture for processing large result sets
- Implement query result streaming to avoid memory overflow
- Create pagination system for client-controlled data flow
- Build streaming parsers for OpenSTA command output
- Implement backpressure handling for slow consumers
- Support async iteration patterns for Python integration

## Relevant Files
- `src/openroad_mcp/timing/stream_engine.py` (to be created)
- `src/openroad_mcp/timing/stream_parser.py` (to be created)
- `src/openroad_mcp/timing/pagination.py` (to be created)
- `src/openroad_mcp/core/manager.py` (integrate streaming)
- `tests/test_streaming.py` (to be created)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Stream processing handles 1M+ timing paths without memory overflow
- [ ] Memory usage stays constant regardless of result set size
- [ ] Pagination provides smooth navigation through large datasets
- [ ] Backpressure prevents buffer overflow with slow consumers
- [ ] OpenSTA output parsing works in streaming mode
- [ ] Async iteration interface for Python consumers
- [ ] Cancellation support for long-running queries
- [ ] Error handling preserves stream integrity

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Design streaming architecture and interfaces
- [ ] Implement base Stream class with async iteration
- [ ] Create StreamBuffer with configurable size limits
- [ ] Build pagination system with cursor management
- [ ] Implement OpenSTA output stream parser
- [ ] Add backpressure handling with flow control
- [ ] Create stream transformation operators
- [ ] Implement cancellation and cleanup logic
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Write performance and stress tests

## Priority
High

## Status
Todo

## Dependencies
- Basic MCP server infrastructure (completed)
- Understanding of OpenSTA output formats

## Technical Details
### Streaming Architecture
```python
class TimingStream:
    async def __aiter__(self):
        return self

    async def __anext__(self):
        if self.done:
            raise StopAsyncIteration
        return await self.get_next_chunk()

    def paginate(self, page_size: int):
        return PaginatedStream(self, page_size)
```

### Memory Management
- Use fixed-size buffers (configurable, default 10MB)
- Implement ring buffer for efficient memory reuse
- Stream chunks of 1000 paths at a time
- Clear processed data immediately

### Backpressure Strategy
- Monitor buffer fill levels
- Pause upstream when buffer >80% full
- Resume when buffer <50% full
- Configurable watermarks

### OpenSTA Integration
```python
# Stream parsing of report_checks output
async for timing_path in stream_parser.parse_report_checks(output_stream):
    yield process_path(timing_path)
```

## Notes
- Consider using asyncio.Queue for backpressure
- May need custom protocol for binary streaming
- Support both text and binary stream formats
- Consider compression for network streaming
