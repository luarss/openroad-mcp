# TICKET-002: Spatial Indexing Implementation

## Description
Implement a spatial indexing system for geometric timing path queries to achieve sub-100ms query performance on designs with 1M+ instances. This will enable fast lookups of timing paths based on physical location, critical path regions, and geometric constraints.

## High-Level Specification
- Research and select optimal spatial indexing algorithm (R-tree, KD-tree, or Quad-tree)
- Implement SpatialIndex class for geometric timing path queries
- Design indexing strategy for timing endpoints and critical paths
- Create index maintenance during incremental timing updates
- Build spatial query interfaces for region-based timing analysis

## Relevant Files
- `src/openroad_mcp/timing/spatial_index.py` (to be created)
- `src/openroad_mcp/timing/query_engine.py` (to be created)
- `src/openroad_mcp/tools/timing_query.py` (to be created)
- `src/openroad_mcp/timing/models.py` (extend with spatial data)
- `tests/test_spatial_index.py` (to be created)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Spatial index achieves <100ms query latency on 1M+ instance designs
- [ ] Support for point, range, and region-based queries
- [ ] Index updates complete incrementally without full rebuild
- [ ] Memory usage for index stays within reasonable bounds
- [ ] Integration with timing path data structures
- [ ] Support for multi-dimensional queries (timing + physical)
- [ ] Concurrent read access without blocking
- [ ] Performance benchmarks validate query speed

## Implementation Steps
- [ ] Research spatial indexing algorithms and select optimal approach
- [ ] Design SpatialIndex base class and interfaces
- [ ] Implement chosen algorithm (likely R-tree for range queries)
- [ ] Create geometric data structures for timing paths
- [ ] Build index construction from timing data
- [ ] Implement query interfaces (point, range, nearest-neighbor)
- [ ] Add incremental update capabilities
- [ ] Optimize memory layout for cache efficiency
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Benchmark against performance targets

## Priority
High

## Status
Todo

## Dependencies
- TICKET-001: Delta-Compressed Checkpoint System (for timing data storage)

## Technical Details
### Algorithm Selection Criteria
- R-tree: Best for range queries and overlapping regions
- KD-tree: Simpler, good for point queries
- Quad-tree: Good for uniform distributions

### Query Types to Support
```python
# Point query: Find paths at specific location
paths = spatial_index.query_point(x=100.5, y=200.3)

# Range query: Find paths in bounding box
paths = spatial_index.query_range(x_min=0, y_min=0, x_max=1000, y_max=1000)

# Nearest neighbor: Find N closest paths
paths = spatial_index.query_nearest(x=100, y=200, n=10)

# Region query: Find paths in arbitrary polygon
paths = spatial_index.query_region(polygon_coords)
```

### Performance Targets
- Point queries: <10ms
- Range queries: <50ms
- Index build: <30s for 1M instances
- Index update: <100ms incremental

## Notes
- Consider using existing libraries (rtree, scipy.spatial) as base
- Index should be serializable for checkpoint integration
- May need multiple indices for different query patterns
- Consider GPU acceleration for very large designs
