## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Completion Requirements
- [ ] Delta-compressed checkpoints reduce storage by 90%
- [ ] Spatial indexing achieves <100ms query latency on 1M+ instances
- [ ] Streaming engine processes large datasets without memory overflow
- [ ] Multi-tier caching improves query performance by 10x
- [ ] OpenSTA wrapper commands maintain compatibility
- [ ] Concurrent access supports multiple simultaneous queries
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 500MB limit
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 95% coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks validate latency requirements

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Spatial indexing complexity**: Start with simpler KD-tree before R-tree
- **Cache coherency issues**: Implement conservative invalidation strategies
- **OpenSTA API changes**: Create abstraction layer with version compatibility
- **Memory management**: Implement gradual degradation under pressure
- **Concurrency bugs**: Use proven locking patterns and extensive testing
