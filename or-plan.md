# OpenROAD MCP Server Features and Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines features and implementation plan for creating an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes OpenROAD's electronic design automation capabilities through a standardized interface using the FastMCP framework.

## Proposed Features

### Core OpenROAD Integration Features

#### 1. Design Flow Tools
- `run_synthesis` - Execute synthesis with various configurations
- `run_placement` - Global and detailed placement operations
- `run_cts` - Clock tree synthesis with custom constraints
- `run_routing` - Global and detailed routing
- `run_drc` - Design rule checking
- `generate_reports` - Timing, power, area analysis

#### 2. Database Operations
- `read_design` - Load LEF/DEF/Verilog files
- `write_design` - Export in various formats
- `query_database` - Search instances, nets, pins
- `get_design_stats` - Area, utilization, timing metrics

#### 3. Design Analysis
- `timing_analysis` - Setup/hold analysis
- `power_analysis` - Static and dynamic power
- `congestion_analysis` - Routing congestion maps
- `floorplan_analysis` - Utilization and placement quality

### Advanced MCP Features

#### 4. Resource Providers
- Design files (LEF, DEF, Liberty)
- Technology libraries and PDK files
- Constraint files (SDC)
- Configuration templates
- Benchmark designs

#### 5. Intelligent Prompts
- Flow configuration templates
- Debugging assistance prompts
- Optimization suggestions
- Best practices guidance

#### 6. Integration Tools
- `compare_designs` - Multi-design comparison
- `regression_test` - Automated testing
- `flow_orchestration` - Multi-step flows
- `design_space_exploration` - Parameter sweeps

### FastMCP-Specific Enhancements

#### 7. Streaming Operations
- Real-time log streaming during long-running operations
- Progress updates for synthesis/PnR flows
- Live design visualization updates

#### 8. Composable Services
- Mount multiple PDK-specific servers
- Technology-aware tool selection
- Hierarchical design management

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Research and Architecture
1. **Research Current OpenROAD Architecture**
   - Examine existing Tcl command structure
   - Understand tool integration patterns
   - Map OpenROAD capabilities to MCP tools

2. **Design MCP Server Architecture**
   - Define tool categories (flow, analysis, database)
   - Plan resource providers for design files
   - Create prompt templates for common workflows

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
3. **Implement Core Features with FastMCP**
   - Set up FastMCP server foundation
   - Implement essential tools (synthesis, placement, routing)
   - Add database query capabilities
   - Create design analysis tools

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
4. **Add Advanced Features**
   - Implement streaming operations for long-running tasks
   - Add design comparison and regression testing
   - Create intelligent prompts for flow guidance

### Phase 4: Validation
5. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Create test suite for all tools
   - Write usage documentation
   - Test integration with various MCP clients

## Technical Considerations

### MCP Protocol Integration
- Utilize JSON-RPC 2.0 for message exchange
- Support multiple transport mechanisms (stdio, HTTP)
- Implement dynamic tool and resource discovery

### FastMCP Framework Benefits
- Simplified server creation and composition
- Built-in authentication and security
- Streaming support for long-running operations
- OpenAPI integration capabilities

### OpenROAD Integration
- Leverage existing Tcl command interface
- Utilize OpenDB for database operations
- Maintain compatibility with existing flows

## Expected Outcomes

This implementation would create a comprehensive MCP server that:
- Exposes OpenROAD's powerful EDA capabilities through a standardized interface
- Enables AI-assisted digital design workflows
- Provides seamless integration with various AI development tools
- Supports both interactive and automated design exploration
