"""Command filter for OpenROAD PTY session security.

Prevents execution of dangerous OS-level Tcl commands by AI agents.

Three-tier design:

  BLOCKED_COMMANDS    — denied in both tools (OS-level Tcl built-ins that can
                        escape the EDA sandbox)

  EXEC_ONLY_PATTERNS  — explicitly known state-modifying commands; denied in
                        the query tool, allowed in the exec tool

  READONLY_PATTERNS   — explicitly known safe read-only commands; allowed in
                        both tools

  Unknown commands    — treated as exec-only: denied in the query tool,
                        allowed in the exec tool (they will fail at the Tcl
                        level if invalid)
