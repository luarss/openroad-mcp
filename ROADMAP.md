# OpenROAD MCP Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development journey of OpenROAD MCP from pre-release to stable production-ready releases.

## Current Status: Pre-Release (v0.x)

We are currently in the **pre-release phase**, focusing on gathering community feedback on core functionality. The goal is to validate the basic feature set and developer experience before stabilizing the API for v1.0.

### What Works Today

- Interactive OpenROAD sessions with PTY support
- Session management (create, list, inspect, terminate)
- Command history and metrics tracking
- Report image visualization from ORFS runs
- Integration with Claude Code and Gemini CLI
- Docker deployment via GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- Streamable HTTP transport

### Pre-Release Goals

The pre-release phase focuses on:

1. **Community Validation** - Getting feedback from early adopters on core features
2. **Developer Experience** - Ensuring smooth installation and setup across platforms
3. **API Refinement** - Identifying pain points and edge cases before API stabilization
4. **Documentation Quality** - Building comprehensive guides based on real user questions

**Feedback Channels:**
- [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/luarss/openroad-mcp/issues) - Bug reports and feature requests
- [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/luarss/openroad-mcp/discussions) - Questions and community discussion
