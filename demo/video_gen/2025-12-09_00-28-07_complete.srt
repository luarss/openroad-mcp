00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,680
Claude proceeds to start processing the written command request.

2
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,080
Claude reads the provided files to assess the current design.

3
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,080
Claude searches for design files and checks for actual location.

4
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:41,080
Claude searches for relevant files in the project file directory.

5
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:49,700
Claude reads the design timing demo files and checks status of the files.

6
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:56,060
Claude finds an error while reading actual constraints for ORFS design.

7
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,000
Claude checks where ORFS is located to resume processing.

8
00:01:00,945 --> 00:01:03,345
The program continues running, displaying errors from previous attempts.

9
00:01:03,345 --> 00:01:07,605
Program checks for OpenROAD scripts, finding them to be available.

10
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:13,065
Program checks the GCD design, reads design and constraint files.

11
00:01:13,065 --> 00:01:18,355
Program runs baseline flow, sees constraint is too aggressive and checks build results.

12
00:01:18,355 --> 00:01:23,755
The program identifies there are no existing results and tries the baseline flow.

13
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:28,525
Program identifies a permission issue and tries different approaches.

14
00:01:28,525 --> 00:01:33,245
The program continues and indicates need to run as root to fix.

15
00:01:33,245 --> 00:01:38,475
Program encounters more issues and gives an error as sudo is required.

16
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:44,815
The program takes a different approach and checks which sessions exist.

17
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:49,875
The program takes another approach since the original constraint has timing violations.

18
00:01:49,875 --> 00:01:54,155
Program applies an optimized timing constraint.

19
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:59,515
Program now applies the improved timing constraint for a better result.

20
00:01:57,070 --> 00:00:09,070
User begins to type in a command to optimise WNS.

21
00:02:00,277 --> 00:02:04,637
The system writes new timing constraints and configurations to files.

22
00:02:04,637 --> 00:02:10,267
The system creates a comprehensive test script to test optimizations.

23
00:02:10,267 --> 00:02:13,857
The script tests multiple clock periods and optimizations.

24
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:21,807
The system writes a WNS optimization script and marks it as executable.

25
00:02:21,807 --> 00:02:30,077
The system is still applying the optimized timing constraints now.

26
00:02:30,077 --> 00:02:35,107
The system writes a quick reference guide for WNS optimization.

27
00:02:35,107 --> 00:02:44,167
The script tests clock periods/config optimizations to find best WNS.

28
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:54,267
System writes and marks the optimization script as executable now.

29
00:02:54,267 --> 00:03:00,007
The system writes WNS optimization quick reference guides.

30
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:10,154
The code is writing optimized timing constraints and configuration files.

31
00:03:10,154 --> 00:03:16,444
The code proceeds to create a test script for multiple optimizations.

32
00:03:16,444 --> 00:03:21,644
The program is writing lines in "optimize_WNS_SH" file.

33
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:26,954
Bash changes the mode of the optimize WNS script file.

34
00:03:26,954 --> 00:03:32,644
Writes to the WNS Optimization Guide a quick reference for the GCD.

35
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:41,214
The program is now updating the README with optimization strategies.

36
00:03:41,214 --> 00:03:51,204
Now the code is updating the ReadMe comprehensive guide file.

37
00:03:51,204 --> 00:03:57,174
The display shows the manual steps for automated optimization.

38
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:07,582
The assistant scrolls through code displayed in the text editor.

39
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:14,702
Code about GCD WNS Optimization and target frequencies is displayed.

40
00:04:14,702 --> 00:04:19,522
It references a reference for GCD/Nangate45 with current status.

41
00:04:19,522 --> 00:04:24,722
Assistant adds new optimization strategy with updated README updates.

42
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:32,542
A comprehensive test script will test multiple optimization strategies.

43
00:04:32,542 --> 00:04:41,162
The WNS optimization guide is being updated for quick reference guide.

44
00:04:41,162 --> 00:04:45,302
It mentions lack of active counts and different approaches.

45
00:04:45,302 --> 00:04:53,452
Demo already shows that the original constraints has timing violations.

46
00:04:53,452 --> 00:05:00,002
An optimized constraint file contains a number that changes.

47
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,887
Baseline flow now running to assess WNS.

48
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:07,387
The next step is to identify timing violations and critical paths.
