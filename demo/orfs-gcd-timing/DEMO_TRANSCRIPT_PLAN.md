# Demo Transcript Plan: OpenROAD MCP Integration with ORFS GCD Design

## Demo Overview

A 10-15 minute live demonstration showing AI-guided timing closure debugging using OpenROAD MCP server integrated with OpenROAD-flow-scripts (ORFS) on the GCD/nangate45 design.

**Key Value**: Transform timing closure from manual, time-intensive process into intelligent, conversational workflow using actual production databases.

## Demo Flow Structure

### Phase 1: ORFS Integration (2-3 minutes)

**Narrator:** "First, let's run the OpenROAD-flow-scripts to generate our timing database"

**Actions:**
- Execute ORFS GCD flow: `make DESIGN_CONFIG=flow/designs/nangate45/gcd/config.mk`
- Show generated artifacts at each stage:
  - `2_floorplan.odb` (659KB) - Post-floorplan with PDN
  - `3_place.odb` (681KB) - Post-placement
  - `4_cts.odb` (709KB) - Post-clock tree synthesis
  - `5_route.odb` (1.2MB) - Post-routing
  - `6_final.odb` (1.2MB) - Final routed design

**Key Files Highlighted:**
- `6_final.odb` - Complete placed and routed database
- `6_final.spef` - Extracted parasitics
- `6_final.sdc` - Final timing constraints

**Talking Points:**
- "These are real production databases, not synthetic examples"
- "Each .odb file contains complete physical and logical design state"
- "ORFS provides industrial-strength RTL-to-GDS flow"

### Phase 2: MCP Server Database Loading (2-3 minutes)

**Narrator:** "Now let's load the ORFS-generated design into OpenROAD via MCP"

**Commands Demonstrated:**
```tcl
# Start OpenROAD MCP interactive session
# Technology setup (required first)
read_lef /home/luars/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/platforms/nangate45/lef/NangateOpenCellLibrary.tech.lef
read_lef /home/luars/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/platforms/nangate45/lef/NangateOpenCellLibrary.macro.lef
read_liberty /home/luars/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/platforms/nangate45/lib/NangateOpenCellLibrary_typical.lib

# Design import

# Load timing constraints
read_sdc /home/luars/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/flow/results/nangate45/gcd/base/6_final.sdc

# Initial timing check

```

**Expected Output:**
```
Startpoint: dpath.a_reg.out[10]$_DFFE_PP_
            (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by core_clock)
Endpoint: dpath.b_reg.out[10]$_DFFE_PP_

```

**Talking Points:**
- "Clean handoff from ORFS synthesized netlist to OpenROAD MCP"
- "All timing data preserved: technology libraries, constraints, logical design"
- "Baseline shows design meets timing with +39ps slack"
- "Note: Schema compatibility requires netlist approach vs. direct .odb loading"

### Phase 3: Violation Injection & AI Analysis (4-5 minutes)

**Narrator:** "Let's create timing violations and analyze them conversationally"

**Setup:**
```tcl
# Load extreme constraints to create violations
read_sdc configs/extreme_pressure_constraints.sdc
report_checks -path_delay max -slack_max 0.0
```

**AI Conversation Script:**

**ðŸ‘¤ User:** "Analyze the timing violations in this GCD design"

**ðŸ¤– AI:** "I found timing violations with worst slack -0.02ns. Let me examine the critical paths..."

*[AI executes: `report_checks -path_delay max -slack_max 0.0`]*

**ðŸ¤– AI:** "Analysis complete. The worst violation occurs in the GCD datapath output:
- **Critical Path**: dpath.a_reg.out[10] â†’ resp_msg[15] (output port)
- **Path Delay**: 0.32ns through combinational logic
- **Available Time**: 0.30ns (4.0ns clock - 3.5ns output delay - 0.2ns uncertainty)
- **Violation**: -0.02ns slack
- **Root Cause**: Aggressive I/O timing constraints vs. output logic depth"

**ðŸ‘¤ User:** "What's the root cause and how can we fix it?"

**ðŸ¤– AI:** "The 4.0ns clock period with 3.5ns output delay is too aggressive for this output path.

**Recommended Fixes:**
1. **Relax I/O timing**: Reduce output delay from 3.5ns to 1.0ns
2. **Relax clock period**: 4.0ns â†’ 5.0ns (250MHz â†’ 200MHz)
3. **Add false paths**: Test and debug signals causing false violations
4. **Reduce clock uncertainty**: 0.2ns â†’ 0.1ns for realistic margins

Would you like me to apply these fixes automatically?"

**ðŸ‘¤ User:** "Yes, apply the fixes and verify timing closure"

### Phase 4: Results Enhancement (3-4 minutes)

**Narrator:** "Watch AI apply intelligent fixes and verify timing closure"

**ðŸ¤– AI Actions:**
```tcl
# Apply optimized constraints (mild_clock_constraints.sdc)
read_sdc configs/mild_clock_constraints.sdc

# Verify timing closure
report_checks -digits 3

# Check for any remaining violations
report_checks -path_delay max -slack_max 0.0
```

**ðŸ¤– AI:** "âœ… **Timing Closure Achieved!**

**Results:**
- All setup violations cleared
- Worst slack: +1.2ns (positive margin)
- Hold timing: All paths meet requirements
- Clock frequency: Stable operation achieved

**Performance Impact:**
- Applied realistic constraints vs. extreme pressure scenario
- **Achievement**: Timing closure achieved through intelligent constraint optimization
- GCD throughput meets typical system requirements"

**Detailed Results Display:**
```
=== TIMING SUMMARY ===
Setup Analysis:
  Worst Slack: +1.200ns (MET)
  Total Negative Slack: 0.000ns
  Failing Endpoints: 0

Hold Analysis:
  Worst Slack: +0.045ns (MET)
  Total Negative Slack: 0.000ns
  Failing Endpoints: 0

Clock Frequency: Successfully meeting timing targets
```

### Phase 5: Cross-Domain Debugging (2-3 minutes)

**Narrator:** "Demonstrate comprehensive analysis capabilities"

**ðŸ¤– AI:** "Let me provide cross-domain analysis correlating timing with physical implementation..."

**Advanced Analysis:**
```tcl
# Detailed path analysis
report_checks -path_delay max -fields {slew cap fanout}

# Path group analysis
report_checks -group_count 10

# Design area and utilization
report_design_area

# Note: Physical .odb comparison requires schema compatibility
# Available for comparison: 4_cts.odb, 5_route.odb, 6_final.odb
```

**ðŸ¤– AI Insights:**
"**Cross-Domain Analysis Results:**

1. **Timing-Logic Correlation**:
   - Critical paths primarily in GCD datapath arithmetic logic
   - Output multiplexing creates timing bottlenecks
   - Register-to-register paths show good timing margins

2. **Constraint Analysis**:
   - I/O timing constraints were the primary violation source
   - Clock period has reasonable margin for this logic complexity
   - False path opportunities exist for test/debug signals

3. **Design Recommendations**:
   - Current timing closure achieved through realistic I/O constraints
   - GCD algorithm shows good timing behavior for this technology
   - Design ready for integration with relaxed constraints"

**Automated Report Generation:**
```bash
# Generate comprehensive timing closure report
report_timing_summary > timing_closure_report.txt
```
